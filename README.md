# TypeScript - Information - Voci
This project has been created as part of the TypeScript Module (Full-Stack Development Program).
The goal of the project was to create - solely using TypeScript - a framework underlying the functioning of an online media platform, for the spurring of and networking among female professionals.

The resulting structure follows three Interfaces, with the respective abstract classes and, finally, non-abstract ones.
One pillar, stemming from IProfessionistaMedia Interface, concerns the Professionals attending the courses at the panel.
A second pillar, following the directive of IProgrammaFormazione Interface, relates to the programs and courses that are available for attendance.
Last but no least, the third pillar, IPiattaforma Interface, concerns the platform (either digital or on paper) for the publishing of the content produced at the programs held through the panel itself. 

Distinctively, each one of the pillars interacts with the other functionalities thus contributing to the set up of an ecosystem, wherein Professionals can sign up to the several programs, and thus collaborating and spurring messages that, once too often, fall on deaf ears.
